		<h2>About Us</h2><br>
		<p>The Panton Eye Center offers comprehensive ophthalmologic care, which includes medical, surgical and optical services. 
		Care is rendered by board-certified ophthalmologists, assisted by a staff which includes optometrists, ophthalmic technicians,

		<p>Medical Director and Founder, Dr. John H. Panton, describes his philosophy of practice, "two words can summarize our approach to eye care:
		innovation and compassion. Surgical techniques and medical treatment are constantly changing and we intend to be at the leading edge of those
		changes. Nonetheless, one thing remains constant-the respect and empathy which we demonstrate to every patient.
		The need to comfort is every bit as important as the need to cure."

	  The term “Cataract” refers to the eye’s lens becoming clouded as a normal part of the aging process. 
	  It is sometimes compared to a window that is frosted, steamed or yellowed. In most cases, 
	  cataracts develop slowly over a number of years. However, conditions such as diabetes and trauma may cause 
	  cataract symptoms to develop early. The term “Cataract” refers to the eye’s lens becoming clouded as a normal 
	  part of the aging process. It is sometimes compared to a window that is frosted, steamed or yellowed. In most 
	  cases, cataracts develop slowly over a number of years. However, conditions such as diabetes and trauma may cause 
	  cataract symptoms to develop early. Blurred vision is the most frequently noted cataract symptom. Many patients 
	  first notice blurred vision during activities such as reading and driving, particularly night driving. It is also 
	  common for cataract patients to experience a generalized haze and difficulty with color perception. Halos and glare 
	  around lights such as headlights or streetlights are also very common. Our doctors will work with you to help 
	  you decide when cataract surgery is needed. Generally, you will want to consider surgery when your cataracts 
	  have progressed enough to seriously impair your vision and affect your daily life. Many people consider poor 
	  vision an inevitable fact of aging, but cataract surgery is a simple, relatively painless procedure to regain vision, 
	  and cataract surgery recovery is a relatively simple process.<br><iframe style="margin-left:150px;margin-right:auto; margin-top:20px;"width="560" height="315" src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/d5D0B2PoC7U" frameborder="0" allow="accelerometer; autoplay; encrypted-media; gyroscope; picture-in-picture" allowfullscreen></iframe>

	  Contact lenses are the preferred method of vision correction for many people. Whether you wear contact lenses for cosmetic reasons or athletic 
	  activities, successful contact lens wear depends on a team effort involving patient, technician and doctor. Our technicians are highly skilled 
	  and have years of experience fitting all types of contact lenses. The risk of complications or infections is minimal with contact lenses if 
	  they are properly cared for and if the patient has regular follow-up care. However, not all patients can wear contact lenses based on individual
	  medical conditions or refractive error. In some instances, glasses are the best option for vision correction. Based upon your eye examination, 
	  the technician and doctor will determine if you are a candidate for contact lenses and will recommend the type of lens that would best meet your needs.

	  Glaucoma is a leading cause of blindness in the United States, especially for older people. Loss of sight from glaucoma is 
	  often preventable if you get treatment early enough. Glaucoma is a disease of the optic nerve. The optic nerve carries the 
	  images we see to the brain. Many people know that glaucoma 
	  has something to do with pressure inside the eye. The higher the pressure inside the eye, the greater the chance of damage to the optic nerve.
	  The optic nerve is made up of a large number of nerve fibers, like an electric cable containing a huge number of wires. 
	  Glaucoma can damage nerve fibers causing blind spots to develop. Usually people don't notice these blind areas until much of the 
	  optic nerve damage has already occurred. If the entire nerve is destroyed, blindness results. 
	  Early detection and treatment by a qualified ophthalmologist are the keys to preventing optic nerve damage and blindness from glaucoma.
